            <p>Together, Abacus ledger principals have more than 313 years of investment banking experience, allowing us
                to provide our clients with Wall Street-quality experience and deep national and international funding
                and buyer connectivity.</p>
            <p>Since our beginnings in 2016, our ambitions have constantly grown. In this article, we detail our vision
                and how we plan to play a fundamental role in the future of Web3.

                People have always protected what they hold precious. When assets were tangible, trust was visible. But
                that world has changed.

                Today, we are witnessing the combined effect of two global trends: a global trust crisis and a massive
                wave of digitization. In 15 years, there will be a trillion devices connected. As more of our lives
                become digital, security threats will inevitably grow.

                Over the next decade, the emergence of critical digital assets crypto, tokens and NFTs will give rise to
                a new Internet of value Web3 through a massive wave of tokenization, bringing programmability to all
                digital assets. From money, art, shares to identity, everything valuable will be converted into tokens,
                logged into blockchains and be managed by individuals and enterprises. By 2027, 10% of the worldâ€™s GDP
                is expected to be stored on public blockchains.

                Securing these digital assets is a critical challenge. This is where we come in. We are Ledger.</p>
            <p>What started as an idea building a secure element chip to safeguard digital assets for crypto enthusiasts
                has evolved into a cutting edge security platform used by millions of individuals and hundreds of
                enterprises.

                Today, we are primarily known for being a secure gateway to crypto and NFTs. In the near future, we will
                be the gateway to assets as diverse as digital currencies, virtual real estates, digital art, luxury
                handbags, Metaverse avatars and more.

                To maintain our world-leading security standards, we relentlessly stress-test our own tech solutions.
                The Ledger Donjon team is made up of world-class experts with extensive crypto security backgrounds.
                They continuously look for vulnerabilities in Ledgers products in a constant effort to improve our level
                of security.

                We believe in a world where users, creators and enterprises manage Web3 value with full ownership,
                security and freedom. We plan to play a fundamental role in this new digital era.

                Explore with us the ever-expanding Web3 galaxy. Join the Ledger ecosystem.</p>
